Fishing for Solitude

this is a fishing spot database that saves spots that a user adds to a database. ultimately a user would want to be able to save their own spots that relate to them. however, as of right now it is a global thing. it allows a user to save a spot by its name, its description and its species that are present.

A user would want to login
A user would want to be able to add spots
A user would want to be able to view those spots
A user would want to be able to update the species if a new one is discovered

I used Node.js, Jquery, mongodb, and heroku and Mlab to host this project

Im particularly proud of the update function because I had yet to fully understand Ajax, and routes as they relate to the DOM and the database

I plan to make users locations embedded in their Schema, as right now the two are unrelated

I want to add login functionality and the ability to view just a users locations





I want to add Google maps api to add pins for the spots on a map.


if you want to run it locally go to my github(Abro1986) and clone the repository. then run a node server, and a connect to a database.
